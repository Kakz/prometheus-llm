## Installation

To get started with Prometheus LLM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kakz/prometheus-llm.git
   cd prometheus-llm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Model Weights**:
   You can find the latest model weights in the [Releases](https://github.com/Kakz/prometheus-llm/releases) section. Download the necessary files and place them in the `models` directory.

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can start using Prometheus LLM. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to run the model:

```python
from model import PrometheusLLM

# Initialize the model
model = PrometheusLLM()

# Generate text
input_text = "What is the nature of consciousness?"
output = model.generate(input_text)
print(output)
```

For more detailed usage examples, refer to the `docs` directory.

## Research Logs

The research logs provide insights into the development process, challenges faced, and solutions found. They are crucial for understanding the evolution of the model and can be found in the `logs` directory. 

Here are some highlights from the research logs:

- **Initial Experiments**: Early tests focused on understanding the capabilities of transformer models in generating coherent text.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Discussions around AI ethics led to the implementation of guidelines for responsible use.
- **Architecture Innovations**: Documenting various architectural changes and their impacts on performance.
